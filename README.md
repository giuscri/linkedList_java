Linked List, in Java
====================

Starting from [this](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html), when Braithwaite says

> After a fair bit of trial and error I've discovered that people who struggle to code don't just struggle on big problems, or even smallish problems (i.e. write a implementation of a **linked list**). They struggle with tiny problems.

I started think if _i_ could design a linked list.

Hence this is a simple implementation of what I though _might_be a linked list -- I know, I'm a bit lazy. :)
